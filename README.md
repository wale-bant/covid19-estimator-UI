# #BuildForSDG Cohort-1 JavaScript Assessment

> Build an overly simplified COVID-19 infection impact estimator

This is an eligibility assessment for the 2020 [#BuildforSDG](https://buildforsdg.andela.com/) program

The assessment empowers me to **attempt** helping society and leaders prepare for the **real big problem** of COVID-19, which is **its impact on lives, health systems, supply chains, and the economy**:

> 1. Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks and other PPE - if _we donâ€™t practice social distancing_.

> 2. Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production (even for essentials like food). These and more from too many people being sick, a sizable number dying (including some of the best people in many fields), and many others affected by the impact of losing loved ones or a world operating in slow motion
